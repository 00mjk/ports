aerc has a known bug where it may crash in the setup procedure if the
terminal is not large enough.  As a workaround either resize the
terminal window so it's large enough to display the text fields or copy
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/aerc/accounts.conf to ~/.config/aerc/accounts.conf
and edit it accordingly.
