Optional dependencies
=====================

Visidata supports many file formats via additional dependencies - these
are not enforced by the port, you can install them with pkg_add(1).
See https://www.visidata.org/formats/ and vd(1) for a list.

At the time of writing, these are supported internally:

  tsv (tab-separated value) 
  csv (comma-separated value) 
  fixed (fixed width text) 
  json (single object) and jsonl/ndjson/ldjson (one object per line). 
  sqlite 
  supported files compressed with zip, gz, bz2, xz

These are supported with additional packages (install with pkg_add):

  yaml/yml		py3-yaml
  pcap			py3-dpkt py3-dnslib
  postgresql		py3-psycopg2
  hdf5			py3-h5py
  html/htm, xml		py3-lxml
  xls			py3-xlrd
  (various via pandas)	py3-pandas

http is also supported as a transport for other file formats; install
py3-requests.

Some of the other supported formats will need additional libraries.
If you try opening a file and see a "module not found" message on the
status line, pkg_locate(1) in the "pkglocatedb" package can help you
determine if it's available in packages, otherwise it may need to
be ported.
